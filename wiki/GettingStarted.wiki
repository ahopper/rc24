* Make some hardware

* Build or get .bin files

* Copy bin files to flash on modules

* Configure settings on rx and tx

* Bind and play.

== Building the code ==

We will shortly post bin files on the server but in the meantime you will have to build them ( or ask on rcgroups ).

===RX & TX code===

To build the Rx and Tx code for the JN5148 modules on a windows pc you will need to download the JN-SW-4041 JN5148 ZBPro SDK Toolchain  and JN-SW-4040 JN5148 ZBPro SDK Libraries from http://www.jennic.com/support/software/ and install them.  This will install a copy of the eclipse IDE.

You then need to get a copy of the rx and tx source code from the goggle code svn server

http://rc24.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rc24

To do this with TortoiseSVN.
Right click on the c:\jennic\application directory in windows explorer and select SVN Checkout.  Fill the dialog in as below and click OK

Then run eclipse and select File/Import then 'Import existing project into Workspace'. Now browse to the c:\jennic\application\rc24 directory and finish.

The build all command in the project menu should build the rx and tx bin files.

===PC Code===

There is a pc program which is used to program the modules and configure them.
The code is in the svn repository at
http://rc24.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/rc24_pc
This can be downloaded in the same way as above to anywhere on your pc.  To build the code you will need a copy of microsoft visual c# express 2008 (free from http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/ )
In visual c# select file/open project and select the rc24_pc.sln file from wherever you downloaded the project to.
 
==Flashing code to Modules==

The bin files can be installed on the modules either with jennic's flash programming utility or our pc app.  These instructions are for the pc app.
