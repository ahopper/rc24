= Introduction =

Welcome to the rc24 project Wiki.  rc24 is a diy 2.4GHz radio control system using the Jennic 802.15.4 radio modules.


= Details =

The project was started some time ago by Alan Hopper after he found the [http://www.jennic.com/products/modules Jennic] 802.15.4 radio modules.  Alan posted some information on the Radio Control forum [http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=801036 RC Groups] and others have picked up from there.  Alan created a transmitter and receiver and has successfully used them to control an rc glider and rc cars. 

During the summer of 2009, Alan and Graham Bloice worked together to design some PCB's for use as receivers and testing transmitters.  The first PCB's have been populated and are working.
